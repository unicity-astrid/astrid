All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Changelog tracking starts with 0.2.0. Prior versions were not tracked.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `astrid-types` crate — shared IPC payload, LLM, and kernel API types with minimal deps (serde, uuid, chrono). WASM-compatible. Both `astrid-events` and the user-space SDK depend on this.
- `yolo` as an alias for `autonomous` workspace mode (`astrid-config`, `astrid-workspace`)

### Changed

- `astrid-events` now re-exports types from `astrid-types` instead of defining them inline. All existing import paths remain valid.
- `astrid-events` `runtime` feature removed — all functionality is now always available. Consumers no longer need `features = ["runtime"]`.

### Removed

- `astrid-sdk`, `astrid-sdk-macros`, `astrid-sys` extracted to standalone repo ([sdk-rust](https://github.com/unicity-astrid/sdk-rust))
