**The persistence layer. Disk for the OS.**

An operating system needs disk. Astrid has two tiers: a raw key-value store for capsule data and a full query engine for system state. Both scale from a single embedded process to a distributed cluster through configuration alone. No code changes. Same API.

## Why two tiers

Capsules need fast, isolated byte storage. The audit log, capability store, and identity system need relations, graph traversal, and SurrealQL queries. Forcing both through the same interface wastes either simplicity or power. So they get separate tiers with separate backing stores, unified behind one crate.

| Deployment | KV backend | DB backend |
|---|---|---|
| Dev / single-agent | SurrealKV (embedded LSM-tree) | SurrealDB (embedded, SurrealKV) |
| Production / multi-node | SurrealKV (embedded) | SurrealDB (over TiKV, Raft) |

The multi-node path exists in the type system and connection strings. It has not been deployed in production yet.

## Namespace isolation

Every KV operation is scoped to a namespace. WASM guests receive a `ScopedKvStore` bound to `wasm:{capsule_id}` and never see the raw key structure. The kernel uses `system:*` namespaces for internal state.

Internally, keys are stored as `"{namespace}\0{key}"`. The null-byte separator is the isolation boundary. Empty namespaces, empty keys, and keys containing null bytes are rejected at validation before reaching the storage engine. `SurrealKvStore` uses transactional range scans bounded by the null-byte separator, so a namespace scan is O(keys in namespace), not O(total keys).

## Secret storage

The `SecretStore` trait provides synchronous credential storage (called from synchronous Extism host functions that bridge to async via `block_on`). Three implementations:

- `KvSecretStore` stores secrets in the KV tier with a `__secret:` key prefix. Works everywhere. No OS-level encryption at rest.
- `KeychainSecretStore` (`keychain` feature) uses the OS keychain via the `keyring` crate. Per-capsule isolation via service name scoping.
- `FallbackSecretStore` (`keychain` feature) probes the keychain once at construction. If accessible, all operations go to keychain. If not, all go to KV. No per-operation fallback that could scatter secrets across both backends.

The `build_secret_store` convenience constructor picks the best available backend.

## Identity

`IdentityStore` manages users and cross-platform identity links. A Discord user, a Telegram user, and a CLI user can all resolve to the same `AstridUserId`. Platform names are normalized (case, whitespace). Path-injection characters (`/`, `\0`) in platform names, user IDs, and display names are rejected before key construction.

## Feature flags

| Feature | Enables |
|---|---|
| `kv` | `SurrealKvStore` (persistent embedded KV) |
| `db` | `Database` (SurrealDB query engine) |
| `keychain` | `KeychainSecretStore` + `FallbackSecretStore` |
| `full` | `kv` + `db` |

`MemoryKvStore` and `KvSecretStore` are always available with no feature flags.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
astrid-storage = { workspace = true, features = ["full"] }
```

```rust
use std::sync::Arc;
use astrid_storage::kv::{MemoryKvStore, ScopedKvStore};

let store = Arc::new(MemoryKvStore::new());
let scoped = ScopedKvStore::new(store, "wasm:my-plugin")?;

scoped.set("config", b"{}".to_vec()).await?;
scoped.set_json("prefs", &my_struct).await?;
let loaded: MyStruct = scoped.get_json("prefs").await?.unwrap();
```

## Development

```bash
cargo test -p astrid-storage --all-features
```
